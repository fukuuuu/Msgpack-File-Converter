# Msgpack-File-Converter (64011546)
The task is basically given some MessagePack data (in binary file). The program will extract the data and transform into other format. You are not required to complete everything in the spec. Let's start with reading simple data like integer number, nil, array of integer first. That way we can give the program some simple MessagePack data and let the program convert that into some format like JSON or CSV.

PS1. to see my code go to msgpack-file-converter(to JSON) > example > there are 3 examples (the project files are "msgpack_file_converter.c" and "prepare msgpack_bin_file.c")
PS2. you should run the file called "prepare msgpack_bin_file.c" in order the create the binary file contaning the msgcode.
